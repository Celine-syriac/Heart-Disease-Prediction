## Heart Disease Prediction Model

### Overview
This repository documents the development of a predictive model to determine the likelihood of individuals contracting heart disease. The project involved the analysis of health data, data cleaning, data preparation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Multiple classification models were trained, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The analysis revealed that the Naive Bayes model outperformed the others, achieving an impressive F1 score of 77%.
